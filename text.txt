So as you can see here we have two files here this is the output file and this is the input
file, here the in input file you can read the text but in output file the output file
is converted to some other text using the substitution cipher which is not recognised
which canâ€™t be recognised by the third person until and unless he gets to know that the
substitution cipher is used here so this is how you quote for substitution cipher and
convert many more text, I hope this programming screen cast was useful to you guys.
Happy learning.
